## Overview
The Recommendation System is a **content-based filtering model** designed to match user preferences with suitable books. It extracts meaningful features from book descriptions using **TF-IDF vectorization** and calculates similarity scores with **cosine similarity** to rank recommendations.  

An interactive **Python-based UI** allows users to input their preferences and get real-time recommendations.
